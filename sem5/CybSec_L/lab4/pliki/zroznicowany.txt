Descriptions of Cerberus vary including the number of his heads Cerberus was usually threeheaded though not always Cerberus had several multiheaded relatives His father was the multi snakefooted Typhon and Cerberus was the brother of three other multiheaded monsters the multisnakeheaded Lernaean Hydra Orthrus the twoheaded dog that guarded the Cattle of Geryon and the Chimera who had three heads that of a lion a goat and a snake And like these close relatives Cerberus was with only the rare iconographic exception multiheaded In the earliest description of Cerberus Hesiods Theogony c 8th  7th century BC Cerberus has fifty heads while Pindar c 522  c 443 BC gave him one hundred heads However later writers almost universally give Cerberus three heads An exception is the Latin poet Horaces Cerberus which has a single dog head and one hundred snake heads Perhaps trying to reconcile these competing traditions Apollodoruss Cerberus has three dog heads and the heads of all sorts of snakes along his back while the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes who probably based his account on Apollodorus gives Cerberus fifty heads three of which were dog heads the rest being the heads of other beasts of all sorts
